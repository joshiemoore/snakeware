# Berlin

A PyGame version of the [Berlin clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Clock) (aka set theory clock)
which was installed in a central location in Berlin on June 17, 1975.
In 1996 it was moved to a new slightly more hidden location where it still stands today.
You could (and still can) also buy official tabletop reproductions of it in Berlin souvenir shops.

This is a 24-hour clock. How to read:

* hour = 5 * lights in first row + lights in second row
* minute = 5 * lights in third row + lights in fourth row
* Seconds are even when top light is lit.
