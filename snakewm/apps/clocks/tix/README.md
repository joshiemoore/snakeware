# TIX

TIX is a TIX clock, based on my old PyTIX code.
TIX is a novelty clock that was available from sites such as
thinkgeek.com about a decade ago.

How to read: Each colored group of squares represents one digit of the current time.
So if there are (from left to right) one red, two green, three blue and four red squares,
that means it's 12:34 right now.

The display updates every four seconds by default and the window is resizable.
The script also has command line options for 24 hour mode and custom update intervals.
