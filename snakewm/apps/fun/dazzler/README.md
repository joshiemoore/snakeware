# Snazzler

Snazzler is a kaleidoscope similar to the one for the Cromemco Dazzler (1976)
(see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-481UnBl_w and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromemco_Dazzler).

The program uses the EGA/Sega Master System color palette (64 colors, 4 levels per channel).

The window is resizable, press Space to pause, "." to advance one frame.
