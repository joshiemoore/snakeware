# Zap

Zap is a Python version of Space Zap (Midway 1980, see https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9692)
running at a resolution of 160x120. Guard the space station from enemy fighters and occasional evil killer satellites.
Play with the cursor keys and press Space to fire.

The player is awarded a bonus base every 75,000 points.
It is easier than the arcade original because difficulty does not ramp up,
on the other hand the enemy can also fire from off-screen in this version.
Then again, you can also shoot off-screen enemies.

The window is resizable, press "p" to pause, "." to advance one frame.
